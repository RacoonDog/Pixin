# Pixin

[Pixie](https://github.com/pixiemc) + [Mixin](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Mixin) = Pixin

It makes Pixie work via a mixin. Works on any version of fabric. (thanks to [curseforge/pixiemod for the multiversion enlightenment](https://codeberg.org/cursefroge/PixieMod))

## Usage

1. Install Essential & Pixin
2. Run the game once with Essential
3. Remove the original Essential jar from your mods folder
4. Copy the actual Essential mod from `<minecraft dir>/essential` (it'll be a .jar and be something like `Essential (fabric_1.20.1).jar`) to your mods folder.
5. Run the game

## Clarifications of Licenses

- No, I'm not associated with Pixie or Essential.
- No, this doesn't use Essential code.
- Yes, ask me for licensing stuff Pixie people if you want. (or just do it yourself, it's not that complex of a thing to do (despite how long it took))
